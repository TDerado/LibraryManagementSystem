    "# **Database Assignment 01: Build a Normalized ERD & Schema**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Project Overview**  \n",
    "For this assignment, you will design and implement a **normalized relational database schema** for one of **five possible application domains**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hospital Management System**  \n",
    "2. **Library Management System**  \n",
    "3. **E-Commerce Store**  \n",
    "4. **Student Enrollment System**  \n",
    "5. **Food Delivery System**  \n",
    "\n",
    "You will choose **one** of these five options. The goal is to practice creating **Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)**, applying **normalization** (up to **Third Normal Form, 3NF**), and defining the **relationships** (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many) between your tables. This schema will serve as the foundation for a future Django project (in the next module), where you will translate these tables into Django models, add a REST API, and eventually deploy to AWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Application Options in Brief**\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are short descriptions of each option. Feel free to adapt the details to your liking, as long as you cover the basic requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hospital Management System**  \n",
    "   - Entities might include:  \n",

    "     - **Borrowing** or **Loans** (loan_id, member_id, book_id, borrow_date, return_date)  \n",
    "   - Potential many-to-many between books and authors, or you might keep it one-to-many if each book has one main author.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **E-Commerce Store**  \n",
    "   - Entities might include:  \n",
    "     - **Customers** (customer_id, name, email)  \n",
    "     - **Products** (product_id, product_name, price, category_id)  \n",
    "     - **Categories** (category_id, category_name)  \n",
    "     - **Orders** (order_id, customer_id, order_date)  \n",
    "     - **Order Items** (order_id, product_id, quantity)  \n",
    "   - Classic many-to-many between orders and products via an **Order Items** table.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Student Enrollment System**  \n",
    "   - Entities might include:  \n",
    "     - **Students** (student_id, name, major, enrollment_date)  \n",
    "     - **Courses** (course_id, course_name, credits)  \n",
    "     - **Enrollments** (student_id, course_id, semester, grade)  \n",
    "     - **Instructors** (instructor_id, name, department)  \n",
    "     - **Classes** or **Course Sections** (class_id, course_id, instructor_id, schedule)  \n",
    "   - Many-to-many between students and courses via **Enrollments** or **Classes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Food Delivery System**  \n",
    "   - Entities might include:  \n",
    "     - **Restaurants** (restaurant_id, name, address, cuisine_type)  \n",
    "     - **Customers** (customer_id, name, address, phone)  \n",

    "     - **Order Details** or **Order Items** (order_id, item_id, quantity)  \n",
    "   - Many-to-many between orders and menu items if a single order can include multiple items, and items can appear in multiple orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pick **one** of these domains and follow the same **design and implementation steps** outlined below.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What You Will Build**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **relational database** that demonstrates a well-structured, **normalized** schema.  \n",
    "- **Multiple tables** representing real-world entities in the chosen domain.  \n",
    "- An **ER Diagram** that clearly shows **entities**, **attributes**, and **relationships**.  \n",
    "- A normalized design, ensuring **1NF**, **2NF**, and **3NF** are met.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Assignment Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Entities & Attributes**  \n",
    "Based on your chosen domain, identify at least **4-5 core entities** and their key attributes. Below are suggestions based on each option:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hospital**: Patients, Doctors, Appointments, Billing, Departments, etc.  \n",
    "- **Library**: Books, Authors, Members, Loans, Publishers, etc.  \n",
    "- **E-Commerce**: Customers, Products, Categories, Orders, Order Items, etc.  \n",
    "- **Student Enrollment**: Students, Courses, Enrollments, Instructors, Classes/Sections, etc.  \n",
    "- **Food Delivery**: Restaurants, Customers, Menu Items, Orders, Order Details, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each entity should have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A **primary key** (e.g., `patient_id`, `book_id`, `customer_id`).  \n",
    "2. Several attributes relevant to the domain (dates, numeric fields, text fields, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Normalization Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unnormalized Draft**  \n",
    "   - Start with a single table or a very rough design that combines multiple data points.  \n",
    "   - Briefly describe why this form is problematic (redundancy, repeating groups, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **First Normal Form (1NF)**  \n",
    "   - Remove repeating groups; ensure columns are **atomic**.  \n",
    "   - Possibly split out separate tables for things like **Doctors**, **Authors**, **Menu Items**, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Second Normal Form (2NF)**  \n",
    "   - Address any **partial dependencies** if you have composite primary keys.  \n",
    "   - For single-column primary keys, consider whether any data belongs in a **separate entity** rather than repeating it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Third Normal Form (3NF)**  \n",
    "   - Eliminate **transitive dependencies**.  \n",
    "   - If a non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute, move it to its own table.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final Normalized Design**  \n",
    "   - Present a **clean set** of tables and relationships with minimal redundancy and clear foreign keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Relationships & ER Diagram**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Relationship Types**  \n",
    "   - **One-to-One** (if any): e.g., a specific “extended profile” for a user.  \n",
    "   - **One-to-Many**: e.g., a single doctor to multiple appointments, a single restaurant to multiple menu items, etc.  \n",
    "   - **Many-to-Many**: e.g., a single order containing multiple items, and each item can appear in multiple orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **ER Diagram**  \n",
    "   - Use **Chen’s Notation** or **Crow’s Foot Notation**.  \n",
    "   - Show all entities, their attributes (especially primary keys and foreign keys), and the lines connecting them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Diagram Clarity**  \n",
    "   - Label or indicate cardinalities near each relationship.  \n",
    "   - If you have a bridging table (like **Order Items**, **Enrollments**, or **Loans**), show any **composite primary key** (e.g., `(order_id, item_id)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. SQL Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "After finalizing your design, create the schema in **PostgreSQL** (or another relational DB) using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **psql CLI**  \n",
    "- **pgAdmin**  \n",
    "- Or another IDE/client\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Required SQL Artifacts**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CREATE TABLE** Statements  \n",
    "   - Include appropriate constraints (**PRIMARY KEY**, **FOREIGN KEY**, **UNIQUE**, **NOT NULL**, etc.).  \n",
    "   - Use `REFERENCES` for foreign key relationships (e.g., `FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **INSERT** Statements (Sample Data)  \n",
    "   - Insert sample data for each table (at least **3-5** rows per table).  \n",
    "   - Ensure your bridging/many-to-many table also has meaningful entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SELECT** Queries  \n",
    "   - Demonstrate **joins** across multiple tables. For instance:  \n",
    "     1. Retrieve a doctor’s appointments (Hospital).  \n",
    "     2. List all items in an order (E-commerce, Food Delivery).  \n",
    "     3. Show all courses a student is enrolled in (Student Enrollment).  \n",
    "   - At least **2-3** queries that explicitly involve relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optional**: Indexing  \n",
    "   - Consider indexing columns that are frequently searched (e.g., `email`, `item_name`, or `title`).  \n",
    "   - This step is not mandatory but good to consider for performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Deliverables**\n",
    "\n",
    "You must **either**:\n",
    "1. **Submit a GitHub Repository Link**  \n",
    "   - Place all of your deliverables in the repo, including:  \n",
    "     - ER diagram image/PDF  \n",
    "     - `.sql` file(s) for CREATE TABLE, INSERT data, and SELECT queries  \n",
    "     - Short normalization write-up (as a `README.md` or separate file)  \n",
    "   - Provide the GitHub link to your instructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**OR**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Direct Message (DM) a Zipped Folder**  \n",
    "   - Compress all deliverables (ER diagram, `.sql` scripts, normalization explanation) into a zip file.  \n",
    "   - **DM** that zip file to the instructor on **Microsoft Teams**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure your deliverables include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ER Diagram**  \n",
    "   - Image/PDF clearly showing entities, attributes, relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Normalization Explanation**  \n",
    "   - Short description (about half a page) of how you moved from an unnormalized design to 3NF.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SQL Script(s)**  \n",
    "   - A `.sql` file or multiple files that includes:  \n",
    "     1. **DROP TABLE IF EXISTS** statements (optional but recommended).  \n",
    "     2. **CREATE TABLE** statements.  \n",
    "     3. **INSERT** statements.  \n",
    "     4. **SELECT** queries demonstrating relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Documentation**  \n",
    "   - A brief set of instructions in `README.md` (or a short text file) on how to run the script(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
